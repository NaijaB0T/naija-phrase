# âœ… SUBTITLE DUPLICATION ISSUE - FIXED

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Summary
AI-generated captions were showing as duplicates in your naija-phrase admin panel because:

1. **Timing tolerance was too strict** (750ms) for AI captions with millisecond precision
2. **Text similarity detection was weak** - missed progressive reveals like "Hello" â†’ "Hello world"  
3. **No pre-insertion duplicate checking** - database constraint only prevented exact matches

## ðŸ”§ Applied Fixes

### 1. Increased Timing Tolerance
- Changed `TIME_LEEWAY_MS` from **750ms to 2000ms** (2 seconds)
- AI captions often have irregular timing gaps that need more flexibility

### 2. Enhanced Text Merging Logic
- Added punctuation-tolerant comparison
- Better progressive reveal detection ("Hello" vs "Hello, world")
- Improved word-based similarity calculation

### 3. Pre-insertion Duplicate Prevention
- Added `checkForSimilarPhrase()` method to check before database insertion
- Uses 90% similarity threshold for longer phrases
- Checks time window of Â±3 seconds for similar content

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy & Test

### Deploy the fix:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Code\Desktop Apps\02_Personal Proj\naija-phrase"
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Test with a problematic video:
1. Go to admin panel: `/admin/videos`
2. Add a video with AI-generated captions
3. Check the phrases page - duplicates should be eliminated
4. Compare with videos processed before the fix

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

**Before Fix:**
- "Why did you even come back? She said you" (appears 2x)
- "were doing so well in the UK. Yeah, I" (appears 2x)

**After Fix:**
- Each phrase appears only once
- Better merged phrases with complete sentences
- Cleaner phrase database overall

The fix maintains data quality while being more intelligent about AI caption processing!
