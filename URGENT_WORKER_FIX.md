# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX: Worker Processing Issues & Monitoring

## âš¡ Current Problem
- Workers getting stuck in "bulk index phrases" step (Cloudflare dashboard shows errors)
- Videos stuck in "Processing Subtitles" status indefinitely
- No real-time monitoring in admin panel

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

### 1. **Fix Bulk Processing (CRITICAL)**
The current bulk processing is hitting Cloudflare D1 limits. Applied more conservative approach:

**Key Changes Made:**
- Reduced batch size from 100 â†’ 25 entries
- Added consecutive error detection (fallback after 3 bulk failures)
- Better parameter validation (D1 has ~32k param limit)
- Automatic fallback to individual inserts when bulk fails

### 2. **Add Worker Monitoring API**
Created `/api/admin/worker-status.ts` to track:
- Processing stage (waiting, fetching, indexing, completed, stuck)
- Progress percentage
- Phrase count
- Time since last update
- Stuck detection (no progress for 5-10 minutes)

### 3. **Add Real-time Admin Monitoring**
Created `WorkerMonitor.js` component for admin panel:
- Shows progress bars and status
- Polls every 5 seconds during processing
- Detects stuck workers
- Provides refresh/retry options

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Deploy the Worker Fix
```bash
cd "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Code\Desktop Apps\02_Personal Proj\naija-phrase"
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Step 2: Add Monitoring to Admin Page
Add this to your admin videos page HTML:
```html
<script src="/components/WorkerMonitor.js"></script>
<script>
// Auto-initialize for processing videos
document.querySelectorAll('[data-status="Processing Subtitles"]').forEach(element => {
  const videoId = element.dataset.videoId;
  const monitor = new WorkerMonitor(videoId, element);
});
</script>
```

### Step 3: Handle Stuck Videos
For currently stuck videos:
1. **Reset stuck videos:** Change status from "Processing Subtitles" â†’ "Pending Subtitle Processing"
2. **Clear partial data:** Delete incomplete phrase entries
3. **Retry processing:** Trigger processing again with fixed workflow

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

**Before Fix:**
- Bulk operations failing with 400+ parameters
- Workers timeout/error on large subtitle files
- No visibility into processing status

**After Fix:**
- Small batches (25 entries) with fallback to individual
- Progress monitoring in admin panel
- Automatic stuck detection and recovery options

## ðŸ”§ Manual Recovery for Stuck Videos

If videos are currently stuck, run this SQL to reset them:
```sql
-- Reset stuck videos to retry
UPDATE videos 
SET processing_status = 'Pending Subtitle Processing',
    error_message = NULL,
    last_processed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE processing_status = 'Processing Subtitles' 
  AND datetime(last_processed_at) < datetime('now', '-10 minutes');

-- Optionally clear partial phrase data for clean retry
DELETE FROM video_phrases 
WHERE video_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM videos 
  WHERE processing_status = 'Pending Subtitle Processing'
);
```

The monitoring will now show real-time status and detect stuck workers automatically! ðŸŽ¯
