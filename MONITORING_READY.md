# 🎯 MONITORING ADDED TO YOUR ADMIN PANEL

## What I Just Did:

1. ✅ **Added real-time monitoring** directly to your videos.astro page
2. ✅ **Shows progress bars** for videos in "Processing Subtitles" status  
3. ✅ **Updates every 3 seconds** with current processing stage
4. ✅ **Detects stuck workers** and shows refresh button
5. ✅ **Auto-refreshes page** when processing completes

## How to Deploy & See It:

### 1. Deploy the changes:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Code\Desktop Apps\02_Personal Proj\naija-phrase"
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### 2. Go to your admin videos page:
```
https://naija-phrase.femivideograph.workers.dev/admin/videos
```

### 3. What you'll see:
- Videos with status "Processing Subtitles" now show:
  - **Progress bar** (0% → 100%)
  - **Live status**: "📥 Fetching subtitles..." → "📝 Indexing phrases (25)..." → "✅ Done! 150 phrases"
  - **Stuck detection**: If no progress for 5+ minutes, shows "⚠️ STUCK" with refresh button

## THAT'S IT! 

No complex setup. The monitoring is **automatically active** for any video in processing status.

You can now:
- ✅ **See real-time progress** of subtitle processing
- ✅ **Know when workers are stuck** 
- ✅ **See phrase count growing** as indexing happens
- ✅ **Get notified when processing completes**

Deploy and refresh your admin page - you'll see the monitoring immediately! 🎯
